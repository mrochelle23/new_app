# JDE Credentials Security Update

## Overview
Updated the barcode scanning application to require user-provided JDE credentials instead of using hardcoded credentials. This enhances security by ensuring users must authenticate with their own JDE credentials before submitting data.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Credentials Modal Component (`credentials-modal.js`)
- **Secure modal interface** for capturing JDE username and password
- **Real-time credential validation** against JDE server
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- **Comprehensive error handling** for authentication failures

### 2. Updated JDE Configuration (`jde-config.js`)
- **Removed hardcoded credentials** for security
- **Dynamic authentication** using user-provided credentials
- **Updated API functions** to require credentials parameter:
  - `getAuthHeader(credentials)` - now requires credentials
  - `getJDEHeaders(credentials)` - now requires credentials  
  - `callJDEAPI(jsonData, credentials)` - now requires credentials
  - `checkNetworkConnectivity(credentials)` - now accepts optional credentials

### 3. Updated Barcode Scanner (`app.js`)
- **Automated flow**: After scanning barcode, prompts for credentials before auto-submit
- **Manual submit**: Clicking submit button now prompts for credentials first
- **New method**: `requestCredentialsAndSubmit()` handles credential collection
- **Updated submit**: `submitToJDE(credentials)` now requires credentials parameter

### 4. Updated Manual Entry (`manual-entry.js`)
- **Form submission**: Now prompts for credentials before submitting data
- **Pre-validation**: Form validation occurs before credential prompt
- **New method**: `requestCredentialsAndSubmit()` handles credential collection
- **Updated submit**: `submitToJDE(credentials)` now requires credentials parameter

### 5. Updated HTML Files
- **Main app** (`index.html`): Added credentials-modal.js script
- **Manual entry** (`manual-entry.html`): Added credentials-modal.js script
- **New test page** (`credentials-test-modal.html`): For testing credential functionality

## User Experience Flow

### Barcode Scanning (Automation)
1. User scans or enters barcode data
2. System parses and generates JDE JSON
3. **NEW**: After 2 seconds, credentials modal appears
4. User enters JDE username and password
5. System validates credentials against JDE server
6. If valid, data is submitted to JDE automatically
7. Success/error message displayed

### Manual Entry
1. User fills out the manual entry form
2. User clicks "Submit" button
3. **NEW**: System validates form, then shows credentials modal
4. User enters JDE username and password
5. System validates credentials against JDE server
6. If valid, data is submitted to JDE
7. Success/error message displayed

## Security Features

### Credential Protection
- **No hardcoded credentials** in source code
- **User-specific authentication** with their own JDE accounts
- **No credential storage** - credentials are only used for immediate submission

### Validation
- **Real-time authentication** against JDE server
- **Network connectivity checks** before submission
- **Comprehensive error handling** for auth failures
- **Form validation** before credential prompt

### User Options
- **Cancel capability** at any point in the process
- **Clean credential handling** - no storage of sensitive information

## Testing

### Test Credentials Modal
- Visit `credentials-test-modal.html` to test the modal functionality
- Test basic modal display and form validation
- Test actual JDE credential validation (if connected to network)

### Production Testing
1. **Barcode Scanning**: Enter sample barcode, verify credential prompt appears
2. **Manual Entry**: Fill form and submit, verify credential prompt appears
3. **Network Issues**: Test behavior when JDE server is unreachable
4. **Invalid Credentials**: Test error handling with wrong username/password

## Files Modified
- `jde-config.js` - Removed hardcoded credentials, updated functions
- `app.js` - Added credential prompt for barcode scanning
- `manual-entry.js` - Added credential prompt for manual entry
- `index.html` - Added credentials-modal.js script
- `manual-entry.html` - Added credentials-modal.js script

## Files Added
- `credentials-modal.js` - New credential modal component
- `credentials-test-modal.html` - Test page for credential functionality

## Backward Compatibility
- **API interface unchanged** - same JDE endpoints and data format
- **User interface preserved** - same look and feel, just adds credential step
- **Error handling enhanced** - better error messages for authentication issues

## Next Steps
1. **Test thoroughly** in development environment
2. **Verify with IT** that JDE authentication endpoint is accessible
3. **Train users** on new credential requirement
4. **Monitor for issues** during initial rollout
5. **Consider additional security measures** if needed (e.g., 2FA, token-based auth)

## Security Note
This update significantly improves security by removing hardcoded credentials, but users should still:
- Use strong JDE passwords
- Not share their credentials
- Report any authentication issues immediately

**Note**: Users will need to enter their credentials each time they submit data, ensuring maximum security with no credential storage.
