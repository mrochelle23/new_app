# JDE Integration Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The JDE Orchestrator Studio was returning empty or null values for key fields:
- `z_MCU_11` (Business Unit) had value `" "` (space) instead of "53080"
- `z_TRDJ_748` (Date) had value `null` instead of the current date
- `z_ALKY_800` and `z_ALKY_802` (Address Numbers) had value `" "` (space) instead of "15212" and "15219"
- `gridData.rowset` was empty `[]` instead of containing the item data

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the JSON structure being sent to JDE. The grid data (rowset) was using direct field values instead of the expected JDE field object format with `title` and `value` properties.

### Old Format (Problematic):
```json
"rowset": [
    {
        "z_DRQJ_165": "20241219",
        "z_UOM_52": "EA",
        "z_UORG_53": 100,
        "z_VR01_608": "PO12345",
        "z_UNCS_836": 500,
        "z_UITM_89": "ITEM001"
    }
]
```

### New Format (Fixed):
```json
"rowset": [
    {
        "z_DRQJ_165": {
            "title": "Requested Date",
            "value": "20241219"
        },
        "z_UOM_52": {
            "title": "UoM",
            "value": "EA"
        },
        "z_UORG_53": {
            "title": "Quantity Ordered",
            "value": 100
        },
        "z_VR01_608": {
            "title": "Customer PO",
            "value": "PO12345"
        },
        "z_UNCS_836": {
            "title": "Purchase Order Unit Cost",
            "value": 500
        },
        "z_UITM_89": {
            "title": "Item Number",
            "value": "ITEM001"
        },
        "rowIndex": 0
    }
]
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated JSON Generation (`app.js` and `manual-entry.js`)
- Modified `generateJDEJson()` function to use proper JDE field object format
- Added `rowIndex` property to each grid item for proper JDE processing
- Enhanced field validation and formatting

### 2. Added Data Validation
- Created `validateJDEData()` function to ensure data integrity
- Added validation for:
  - Non-empty item numbers
  - Valid quantities (> 0)
  - Proper string formatting and trimming
  - Required field presence

### 3. Enhanced Configuration (`jde-config.js`)
- Added validation rules for JDE fields
- Improved field length and type specifications
- Better documentation of field requirements

### 4. New Testing Tools
- Created `json-format-test.html` for comparing old vs new JSON formats
- Added comprehensive validation checks
- Enhanced existing test suite in `test.html`

### 5. Field Mapping Improvements
- Ensured all main form fields use proper `{title, value}` structure
- Fixed grid data rowset format to match JDE expectations
- Added proper date formatting (YYYYMMDD)
- Validated address number formats

## Key Technical Details

### Date Format
- Uses `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., "20241219")
- Generated from current date using `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0].replace(/-/g, '')`

### Business Unit and Address Numbers
- Business Unit: "53080" (5 characters)
- Address Number 1: "15212" (5 characters)
- Address Number 2: "15219" (5 characters)

### Grid Data Structure
- Each field in the rowset now has `title` and `value` properties
- Added `rowIndex` for proper JDE grid processing
- Maintains column definitions for JDE reference

## Expected Results
With these changes, JDE should now:
1. Properly receive and process the business unit ("53080")
2. Accept the date in the correct format
3. Process the address numbers correctly
4. Populate the grid data with item information
5. Generate a valid sales order in the system

## Testing
Use the new `json-format-test.html` page to:
1. Compare old vs new JSON formats
2. Validate field structures
3. Ensure proper data formatting
4. Test with sample data before live submission

## Files Modified
- `app.js` - Updated JSON generation and added validation
- `manual-entry.js` - Updated JSON generation and added validation
- `jde-config.js` - Added validation rules and enhanced configuration
- `test.html` - Added JSON format testing
- `index.html` - Added link to JSON format test
- `json-format-test.html` - New comprehensive testing tool

The application should now generate JDE-compatible JSON that properly populates all fields and creates valid sales orders in the JDE system.
